\chapter*{后记}

Sometimes I asked myself: is it necessary, or even make sense, to put such a personal note online? After all the contents in this note contain tons of `na\"\i ve' statements so it's actually far from being well-organized or worth used for reference. But later when I took part in the edition work of \href[]{https://feiyue.online/}{THU 2023 Feiyue Project}, I realized that things don't have to be perfect to be shared. Or, to quote one of my friends:
\begin{quote}
    我觉得能让后面的人意识到我们也曾经挣扎过就已经很有意义了。
\end{quote}
So I decided to put this note online, hoping that it could be of some help to anyone like me, once confusing and struggling. You don't even have to read it, just knowing that someone else has been through the same thing as you do might be enough. And for the same reason, I've been try to set up some online project, or connect with statistics minor students like me, hoping to help them in some way. I hope that this note could be a small step towards this goal. And I hope that I could keep this spirit in the future.

If any of the contents in this note is helpful to you, please feel free to share it with others. And if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat, please contact me via email: \href{mailto:v1ncent19@outlook.com}{v1ncent19@outlook.com}.
